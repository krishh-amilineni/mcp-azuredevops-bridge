## üìã Advanced Wiki Usage

The DevOps Bridge includes enhanced wiki functionality that can help you access documentation more effectively:

### Available Wiki Tools

- `list_wiki_pages` - Lists all wiki pages, optionally from a specific path
- `get_wiki_page` - Retrieves the content of a specific wiki page
- `manage_wiki_page` - Creates or updates a wiki page
- `search_wiki` - Searches for content across wiki pages
- `get_available_wikis` - Lists all available wikis in your Azure DevOps organization

### Wiki Troubleshooting

If you're having trouble accessing wiki content:

1. Use the `get_available_wikis` tool to see all available wikis and their IDs
2. Check that your PAT token has appropriate permissions for wiki access
3. Verify that the wiki path is correct - wiki paths are case-sensitive
4. Enable verbose logging to see detailed request and response information

## üîí Security

This integration uses Personal Access Tokens (PAT) for authenticating with Azure DevOps. Ensure your PAT has the appropriate permissions for the operations you want to perform.
