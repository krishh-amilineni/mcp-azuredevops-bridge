# Azure DevOps Wiki Integration Findings

## Summary
We have been troubleshooting issues with accessing the EdGraph Engagement project wikis in Azure DevOps through the MCP server. While we've made significant progress in understanding and fixing the API integration, there remain challenges with the Windsurf-MCP server communication.

## Key Findings

1. **Root Cause Identified**: The primary issue was that the wiki API calls were not including the project name in the URL path, resulting in 404 errors.

2. **API Implementation Fixed**: We successfully modified the following functions to include the project name:
   - `handleGetWikiPage`
   - `handleListWikiPages`
   - `handleSearchWiki`
   - `getWikisForProject`

3. **Successful Direct Testing**: A standalone test script (`direct-test.go`) confirmed that our API implementation works correctly. We were able to:
   - Successfully retrieve the list of wikis for the "EdGraph Engagement" project
   - Successfully access the content of the "EdGraph-Engagement.wiki" wiki

4. **Current Blocker**: Despite the API fixes, we're still experiencing integration issues between Windsurf and the MCP server. The server process runs but doesn't appear to respond to Windsurf's requests.

## Technical Changes Made

1. **Response Body Handling**: Fixed an issue where the response body was being read twice, which could cause errors since the body can only be read once.

2. **URL Construction**: Updated all wiki-related API calls to include the project name:
   ```go
   // Before
   wikiApiUrl := fmt.Sprintf("%s/_apis/wiki/wikis?api-version=7.2-preview", config.OrganizationURL)
   
   // After
   wikiApiUrl := fmt.Sprintf("%s/%s/_apis/wiki/wikis?api-version=7.2-preview", 
       config.OrganizationURL,
       url.PathEscape(config.Project))
   ```

3. **Error Logging**: Enhanced error logging to capture more detailed information about API responses, which helped identify the issue.

## Next Steps

1. **Check Port Configuration**: Verify that the MCP server is listening on the correct port that Windsurf is expecting.

2. **Enable Detailed Logging**: Add more detailed logging in the MCP server's main execution path to understand where the communication might be breaking down.

3. **Test Basic Endpoints**: Create simple test endpoints in the MCP server to verify that Windsurf can connect to and receive responses from the server.

4. **Check Network Configuration**: Ensure there are no network or firewall settings blocking the communication between Windsurf and the MCP server.

5. **Verify Authentication**: Confirm that the authentication mechanism between Windsurf and the MCP server is working correctly.

## Conclusion
The core API integration with Azure DevOps for accessing wikis has been fixed and works correctly when tested directly. The remaining issues appear to be related to the communication between Windsurf and the MCP server, which will require further investigation.
